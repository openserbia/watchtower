## [Unreleased]

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **`--audit-unmanaged`** flag (env: `WATCHTOWER_AUDIT_UNMANAGED`). With
  `--label-enable` active, warns once per poll for every container that carries
  no `com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable` label at all, so silent exclusions
  stop looking identical to intentional opt-outs.
- **Bounded exponential backoff** for registry HTTP calls (`pkg/registry/retry`).
  Wraps the oauth challenge, bearer-token exchange, and manifest HEAD with up to
  3 attempts (500 ms → 4 s + jitter) on network errors, 5xx, 429, and the
  401/403/404 flakes observed on registry oauth endpoints under load.
- **In-memory bearer-token cache** (`pkg/registry/auth`). Cuts registry
  authentication traffic dramatically: a poll across N containers on the same
  registry+repository scope now issues one token exchange instead of N. Keyed
  by auth URL + credential hash, respects the registry's `expires_in` (default
  60 s per the Docker token spec) minus a 10 s skew, and is concurrency-safe.
  Also reduces exposure to the oauth-endpoint flakes the retry wrapper handles.

### Fixed
- **Containers stuck un-updatable after their source image is garbage-collected.**
  When the image a container was created from has been removed locally
  (typically by a prior `--cleanup` run after the tag moved to a newer digest),
  `Container.GetContainer` now falls back to inspecting the container's image
  *reference* (e.g. `myrepo/app:latest`) instead of returning `imageInfo: nil`.
  This lets `VerifyConfiguration` pass and the update flow proceed on the
  next poll. Fixes [upstream#1217](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower/issues/1217)
  (nil-pointer panic in `Container.ImageID()`) and
  [upstream#1413](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower/issues/1413)
  ("Unable to update container: Error: No such image" loop).
- **`--cleanup` no longer deletes the freshly-pulled replacement image** after
  the fallback path above kicks in. Cleanup now targets `containerInfo.Image`
  (the ID Docker recorded at container creation) via the new
  `Container.SourceImageID()`, not whatever `imageInfo` currently holds.
  `RemoveImageByID` also treats `NotFound` as success so already-GC'd old
  images stop logging spurious errors. Fixes
  [upstream#966](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower/issues/966)
  (`conflict: unable to delete <id> - image is being used by running container`).
- **Compose-deploy races** (`docker compose up` between two polls) no longer
  abort the entire scan. `ListContainers` skips containers that vanish between
  list and inspect, and `StopContainer` tolerates `NotFound` on kill.
- **Pull-failure log level raised** from `info` to `warn` in
  `actions.Update`, so operators running `WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATIONS_LEVEL=error`
  are actually notified of stuck containers instead of the failure being
  silently swallowed.

### Changed
- `Container` interface gained `SourceImageID()` — returns the raw image ID
  Docker recorded against the container at creation time, stable across
  imageInfo fallbacks. Existing `ImageID()` / `SafeImageID()` semantics are
  unchanged.
